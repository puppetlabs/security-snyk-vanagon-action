# security-snyk-vanagon-action

This action runs snyk on generated gemfiles for vanagon builds.

### What this will identify
This tool will use the output of `vanagon inspect` in order to identify any gems pulled in from `rubygems.org`. It builds a pseudo Gemfile for each project and platform in the `configs` directory of a vanagon repository. It then creates a Gemfile.lock from the pseudo Gemfile and scans it with snyk.

## Inputs

### mendApiKey (required)
The mend API key

### mendToken (required)
The mend user token

### mendURL (required)
The mend URL for your mend endpoint

### productName (required)
The name of the product to send results to

### projectName (required)
the name of the project. Note that the branch, project, and platform will be appended. See branch below for details

### branch
Branch name to prepend to the snyk project name. If branch is set to `""` then the name in snyk would be in the form `<project>_<platform>`. If branch is not empty it will be in the form `<branch>_<project>_<platform>`. Branch can be automatically set using `{{ github.ref_name }}`. Branch is limited to < 10 alphanumeric characters plus dash.

### skipProjects
A comma separated list of projects to skip

### skipPlatforms
A comma separated list of platforms to skip

### sshKey
A SSH key to install on the docker container in `/root/.ssh/<sshKeyName>`. It **must** be base64 encoded

### sshKeyName
